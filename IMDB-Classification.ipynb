The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal   I couldn't say I was ready for it   but as I watched more   I developed a taste for Oz   and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence   but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel   inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it   well mannered   middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz    may become comfortable uncomfortable viewingth...\n",

Each one is connected in one way                                                                                                                                                 or another to the next person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but no one seems to know the previous point of contact.

We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment   as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction.

Not just violence   but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel   inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it   well mannered   middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz    1\n",

As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\"                                                                              negative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NaN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 NaN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          NaN                                                                                                                                                NaN                                                                                       NaN                                                                                                                                        NaN                                             NaN                                                                                                      NaN                                                                                                                 NaN                                                                NaN                   NaN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   NaN                                                                    NaN                                                                                                          NaN                                 NaN                     NaN                          NaN                                                                            NaN                                                             NaN                                                 NaN             NaN                                                                                                                            0\n",
              "\"Petter Mattei's \"\"Love in the Time of Money\"\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way                                                                                                                                                 or another to the next person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but no one seems to know the previous point of contact.

We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits.

There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith.
